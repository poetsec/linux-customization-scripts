# Linux Customization Scripts
These scripts aim to help people new to customizing Linux distributions get up and running with the basic programs and extensions they need to cusomtize their desktop environment as well as a few themes (shell, icons, GTK, etc.) to get started with. 

## debian-gnome-setup
This script is for Debian-based Linux distributions running a Gnome desktop environment. It installs Gnome Tweaks, Gnome Shell Extensions, the native host connector for Gnome Shell Extensions (chrome-gnome-shell), as well as the Arc theme and Arc icons, Xenlism Minimalism shell theme, and the Pop OS theme. 

After running the script, you will need to go to extensions.gnome.org and switch the button to the on position to enable Gnome Shell Extensions. After that you should be set up and ready to use Gnome Tweaks and Gnome Shell Extensions to customize your desktop environment.
